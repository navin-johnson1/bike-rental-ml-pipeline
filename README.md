# End-to-End ML Pipeline for Bike Demand Prediction

This project extends prior work in data preparation and visualization to build a complete machine learning pipeline for forecasting hourly bike rental demand. It includes feature engineering, data scaling, and implementation of multiple regression models—Linear, Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net—alongside hyperparameter tuning and performance evaluation using MAE, MSE, and R². Polynomial features are introduced to capture non-linear relationships, and models are validated through cross-validation and test data comparison. The final phase summarizes insights, highlights feature importance, and offers recommendations for future improvements.

The outputs are as follows:
- Encoded dataset: bike_rental_features.csv
- Best polynomial model: best_poly_model.pkl
- Correlation heatmap: correlation_heatmap.png
- Report: report.txt
