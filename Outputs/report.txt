Bike Rentals Forecasting — Summary Report
--------------------------------------------------
Task 1 (Feature Engineering): 
- Numeric features: ['hour', 'temperaturec', 'humidity', 'wind_speed_m_s', 'visibility_10m', 'dew_point_temperaturec', 'solar_radiation_mj_m2', 'rainfallmm', 'snowfall_cm', 'holiday', 'functioning_day', 'year', 'month', 'day', 'dayofweek', 'is_weekend']
- Categorical features (one-hot encoded): ['seasons']
- Scaling applied via StandardScaler inside modeling pipelines (no leakage).
- Encoded features saved to 'bike_rental_features.csv'.
Task 2 (Models without polynomial): 
  * Linear: MAE=330.303, MSE=192180.471, Rsquared=0.5387
  * Ridge: MAE=330.244, MSE=192144.978, Rsquared=0.5388
  * Lasso: MAE=330.295, MSE=192176.135, Rsquared=0.5388
  * ElasticNet: MAE=330.113, MSE=192067.817, Rsquared=0.5390

Task 3 (Polynomial features):   * Linear_poly: MAE=263.706, MSE=136932.581, Rsquared=0.6713  * Ridge_poly: MAE=264.410, MSE=137187.998, Rsquared=0.6707  * Lasso_poly: MAE=266.880, MSE=139832.398, Rsquared=0.6644  * ElasticNet_poly: MAE=292.806, MSE=167843.358, Rsquared=0.5972

- Best polynomial model: Linear_poly
Task 4 (Validation): 
- 5-fold CV used on train splits to assess generalization.

- Compared test metrics across all models (linear vs polynomial).
Task 5 (Insights & Recommendations): 
- Temperature, hour, humidity, and seasonal effects typically correlate with demand.
- Polynomial models often capture non-linear relationships (e.g., temperature vs. demand).
- For the business: consider dynamic pricing & staffing by hour/season/weather signals.
- Further improvements: add lag features (previous hour/day), holiday calendars, weather forecasts,
interaction terms (e.g., temperature × hour), and try tree-based models (Random Forest, XGBoost).
